1. **CodeGlance**- A tool that transforms any GitHub repository into an intuitive, visual interface for quickly understanding and navigating codebases.
    
    *New developers and contributors often face significant challenges when attempting to navigate and understand unfamiliar codebases hosted on GitHub. The traditional directory structure and raw code views can be overwhelming, making it difficult to quickly gain context or identify how different components fit together. This slows down onboarding, reduces productivity, and increases the learning curve for individuals who are trying to contribute or simply explore a project. CodeGlance addresses this issue by enabling users to simply paste a GitHub repository URL and instantly access a user-friendly interface that allows them to efficiently glance through, explore, and understand the overall structure and functionality of the codebase.*
