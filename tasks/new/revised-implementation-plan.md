# CodeGlance - Revised Implementation Plan

## Core Mission: Making Codebases Instantly Understandable

**The primary goal of CodeGlance is to transform complex, overwhelming codebases into clear, digestible documentation that a developer can understand in minutes, not hours.**

## Overview
**IMPORTANT**: This implementation is focused ONLY on creating comprehensive Gemini prompts for repository analysis. We are NOT building any web application, API routes, or frontend interfaces. The goal is to create a set of well-structured prompts that can generate **human-friendly, easy-to-read documentation** that makes understanding any codebase feel like having a knowledgeable colleague walk you through it.

## Key Documentation Principles

### 1. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Start with the big picture, then zoom into details
- "What does this do?" ‚Üí "How is it organized?" ‚Üí "Where do I start?" ‚Üí "How does it work?"

### 2. **Plain English First**
- No jargon in overview sections
- Technical details come after conceptual understanding
- Every file purpose explained in one simple sentence

### 3. **Visual Over Textual**
- Use diagrams, trees, and visual markers
- Icons and emojis for quick recognition
- Structured layouts that are scannable, not walls of text

### 4. **Context-Rich Navigation**
- Always show where you are in the bigger picture
- Cross-references between related sections
- "If you're looking for X, go to Y" guidance

### 5. **Learning Path Approach**
- Clear starting points for newcomers
- Suggested reading order
- "Understand this before that" relationships

## Implementation Focus: User-Friendly Prompt Engineering

The implementation consists of creating prompts that generate documentation optimized for **rapid comprehension**, not technical completeness. Every prompt should prioritize clarity and understanding.

## Prompt Structure & Organization

### Phase 1: Core Prompt Templates

#### 1.1 Master Analysis Prompt
**File:** `prompts/master-analysis.txt`

A comprehensive prompt that instructs Gemini to:
1. Analyze the repository with a focus on **making it understandable to newcomers**
2. Generate **reader-friendly** markdown documentation 
3. Output files to a `guide/` directory
4. Use **progressive disclosure** - start simple, add detail gradually
5. Write like you're **explaining to a colleague**, not documenting for robots

#### 1.2 Project Overview Prompt
**File:** `prompts/project-overview.txt`

Generates: `guide/overview.md` - **The 5-Minute Understanding**
- **"What is this?"** - One paragraph a junior dev would understand
- **"What problem does it solve?"** - Real-world context
- **"How do I run it?"** - Copy-paste commands that just work
- **"Where do I start reading?"** - The 3 most important files
- **"What should I know first?"** - Key concepts before diving in

#### 1.3 Visual Directory Tree Prompt
**File:** `prompts/visual-tree.txt`

Generates: `guide/visual-tree.md` - **The Visual Map**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ components/     ‚Üê UI building blocks
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öõÔ∏è Button.tsx  ‚Üê Reusable button with 3 variants
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öõÔ∏è Card.tsx    ‚Üê Container for content sections
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ api/           ‚Üê Backend endpoints
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚ö° auth.ts     ‚Üê START HERE: User login/signup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚öôÔ∏è config.ts       ‚Üê App settings and environment
```
- **Intuitive icons** that make sense at a glance
- **Purpose annotations** that explain "why this exists"
- **START HERE markers** for critical files
- **Relationships shown** visually, not just listed

#### 1.4 File Insights Prompt
**File:** `prompts/file-insights.txt`

Generates: `guide/file-insights.md` - **The Deep Dive (When You Need It)**
```markdown
## üìÑ auth.controller.ts
**Purpose**: Handles all user authentication requests

**Key Functions**:
- `login()` ‚Üí Validates credentials, returns JWT token
- `signup()` ‚Üí Creates new user, sends welcome email  
- `resetPassword()` ‚Üí Sends reset link to user's email

**Connects To**:
- Uses: `UserService` for database operations
- Called by: API routes in `/api/auth/*`
- Tests: See `auth.controller.test.ts`

**Quick Example**:
\```javascript
// This is how you'd use it:
const token = await authController.login(email, password);
\```
```
- **Purpose-driven descriptions** not technical specs
- **"How to use it"** examples included
- **Connection mapping** shows the bigger picture

#### 1.5 Architecture Analysis Prompt
**File:** `prompts/architecture.txt`

Generates: `guide/architecture.md` - **The Big Picture**
```
User Request ‚Üí [Frontend React App] 
                    ‚Üì
              [API Gateway]
                ‚Üì        ‚Üì
        [Auth Service] [Data Service]
                ‚Üì        ‚Üì
              [PostgreSQL DB]
```
- **Flow diagrams** that show how everything connects
- **"Follow the data"** narratives 
- **Common user journeys** mapped visually
- **Why it's built this way** explanations

#### 1.6 Quick Start Guide Prompt
**File:** `prompts/quick-start.txt`

Generates: `guide/quick-start.md` - **Get It Running in 5 Minutes**
```markdown
## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone and Install (1 minute)
\```bash
git clone [repo-url]
cd [project-name]
npm install
\```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment (2 minutes)
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add:

gemini -p "@prompts/depth/quick-analysis.txt" --context repos/small-project
```

### Custom Analysis Chain
```bash
# First get overview
gemini -p "@prompts/project-overview.txt" --context repos/project

# Then analyze architecture
gemini -p "@prompts/architecture.txt" --context repos/project

# Finally generate file insights
gemini -p "@prompts/file-insights.txt" --context repos/project
```

## Prompt Design Principles for Maximum Readability

### 1. **Write for Humans, Not Machines**
- Use conversational language in explanations
- Technical accuracy with approachable tone
- "Explain it like I'm smart but new to this codebase"

### 2. **Progressive Information Architecture**
```
Level 1: What is this? (30 seconds)
  ‚Üì
Level 2: How is it organized? (2 minutes)
  ‚Üì  
Level 3: Where do I start? (5 minutes)
  ‚Üì
Level 4: Deep technical details (as needed)
```

### 3. **Visual Hierarchy That Guides the Eye**
- **Bold** for key concepts
- `Code` for technical terms
- ‚Üí Arrows for relationships
- üìÅ Emojis for quick recognition
- Boxes and diagrams over paragraphs

### 4. **Context Over Content**
Instead of: "This function processes data"
Write: "This function takes user input from the form and validates it before saving to the database"

### 5. **Examples Over Explanations**
Show don't tell - include code snippets that demonstrate usage rather than lengthy descriptions.

## Success Criteria - Is It Actually Easier to Understand?

### The 5-Minute Test
A developer who has never seen the codebase should be able to:
- ‚úÖ Understand what the project does
- ‚úÖ Know how to run it locally
- ‚úÖ Identify where to make their first change
- ‚úÖ Understand the basic architecture
- ‚úÖ Know who to ask (or where to look) for help

### Readability Metrics
1. **Instant Comprehension**: Overview should be understood in 30 seconds
2. **Scannable Structure**: Find any topic in under 10 seconds
3. **Zero Confusion**: No undefined terms or assumed knowledge in basic sections
4. **Progressive Depth**: Can stop reading at any level and still have value
5. **Actionable**: Every section enables the reader to DO something

### User Feedback Goals
- "This made a complex codebase feel approachable"
- "I understood in 10 minutes what usually takes hours"
- "It feels like a colleague explained it to me"
- "I knew exactly where to start"

## Implementation Focus

This implementation is purely focused on **prompt engineering for human understanding** - creating intelligent prompts that transform complex repositories into documentation that feels like a knowledgeable colleague walking you through the code. 

**The measure of success is not technical completeness, but how quickly someone can understand and start contributing to a codebase.**

Key deliverable: A collection of specialized prompts that work with the `gemini -p` command to create documentation that makes any codebase approachable, understandable, and navigable in minutes instead of hours.
