description = "Execute comprehensive code analysis workflow on a GitHub repository using orchestrated prompts"
prompt = """
You are an expert code analyst and documentation generator. Execute a comprehensive code analysis workflow on the provided GitHub repository.

## Task: Repository Analysis Orchestration

Given a GitHub repository URL, perform the following workflow:

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
# Create repos and guide directories at project root
mkdir -p repos guide

# Extract repository name and clone
REPO_NAME=$(basename "{{args}}" .git)
git clone "{{args}}" "repos/$REPO_NAME"

# Note: Stay in project root, don't cd into cloned repo
# This ensures guide/ is created at project root level

# Verify repository structure
echo "Repository cloned successfully. Structure:"
ls -la "repos/$REPO_NAME"
```

### 2. Sequential Analysis Execution

Execute the following analysis prompts in order, using the content from the `prompts/` folder as guidance:

#### Phase 1: Foundation Understanding (project-overview)
- Analyze the project's purpose, goals, and core functionality
- Identify technology stack, frameworks, and dependencies
- Document key features and problem context
- **Reference**: Use guidance from `prompts/project-overview.md`
- **Output**: Generate `./guide/01-overview.md`

#### Phase 2: Structure Mapping (visual-tree)  
- Create comprehensive directory tree with meaningful icons
- Identify important files and their purposes
- Document file organization patterns
- **Reference**: Use guidance from `prompts/visual-tree.md`
- **Output**: Generate `./guide/02-tree.md`

#### Phase 3: Deep File Analysis (file-insights)
- Analyze critical files with usage examples
- Document key functions and their purposes
- Map file connections and dependencies
- **Reference**: Use guidance from `prompts/file-insights.md`
- **Output**: Generate `./guide/03-file-insights.md`

#### Phase 4: System Architecture (architecture)
- Document system design with diagrams
- Map component relationships and data flow
- Identify design patterns and architectural decisions
- **Reference**: Use guidance from `prompts/architecture.md`
- **Output**: Generate `./guide/04-architecture.md`

#### Phase 5: Developer Onboarding (quick-start)
- Create step-by-step setup instructions
- Document prerequisites and environment setup
- Provide common commands and troubleshooting
- **Reference**: Use guidance from `prompts/quick-start.md`
- **Output**: Generate `./guide/05-quick-start.md`

#### Phase 6: Master Analysis (master-analysis)
- Synthesize all previous analyses
- Create cross-referenced documentation suite
- Generate executive summary and navigation
- **Reference**: Use guidance from `prompts/master-analysis.md`
- **Output**: Multiple interconnected guide files

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

**For each phase:**
1. Read the corresponding prompt file from `prompts/` folder for detailed instructions
2. Analyze the repository according to those specifications
3. Generate comprehensive documentation following the prompt guidelines
4. Ensure outputs build upon previous analysis results
5. Maintain consistent formatting and cross-references

**Error Handling:**
- If cloning fails, provide troubleshooting steps
- Continue with remaining phases if one fails
- Provide summary of successful and failed operations

**Output Organization:**
- Create `./guide/` directory in the current working directory
- Save each phase output with descriptive filenames
- Generate navigation index linking all documents
- Ensure cross-references between guides work properly

### 4. Pre-execution Validation

Before starting:
1. Validate GitHub URL format
2. Check if repository already exists in `repos/`
3. Verify git is installed and accessible
4. Ensure sufficient disk space

### 5. Post-execution Summary

After completion:
- Summarize all executed phases
- Provide links to generated documentation
- Highlight key insights and findings
- Suggest next steps for repository exploration

## Expected Directory Structure After Analysis:
```
./
├── repos/[repo-name]/     # Cloned repository
└── guide/                 # Generated documentation
    ├── 01-overview.md
    ├── 02-tree.md
    ├── 03-file-insights.md
    ├── 04-architecture.md
    ├── 05-quick-start.md
    └── [additional files from master-analysis]
```

## Execution Command:
Begin comprehensive analysis workflow for repository: {{args}}

**Important**: Follow the prompts in the `prompts/` folder exactly as specified. Each prompt contains detailed instructions for that specific phase of analysis. The orchestrator should execute them sequentially, building a complete understanding of the repository.
